# Module 01 - Design and Implement the serving layer

### Lab setup and pre-requisites
Before starting this lab, ensure you have successfully completed the setup steps to create your lab environment. 

Then complete the following setup tasks to create a dedicated SQL pool.

> **Note**: The setup tasks will take around 6-7 minutes. You can continue the lab while the script runs.

### Task 1: Create dedicated SQL pool

1. Open Synapse Studio (<https://web.azuresynapse.net/>).

2. Select the **Manage** hub.

    ![The manage hub is highlighted.](images/manage-hub.png "Manage hub")

3. Select **SQL pools** in the left-hand menu, then select **+ New**.

    ![The new button is highlighted.](images/new-dedicated-sql-pool.png "New dedicated SQL pool")

4. In the **Create dedicated SQL pool** page, enter **`SQLPool01`** (You <u>must</u> use this name exactly as displayed here) for the pool name, and then set the performance level to **DW100c** (move the slider all the way to the left).

5. Click **Review + create**. Then select **Create** on the validation step.
6. Wait until the dedicated SQL pool is created.

> **Important:** Once started, a dedicated SQL pool consumes credits in your Azure subscription until it is paused. If you take a break from this lab, or decide not to complete it; follow the instructions at the end of the lab to **pause your SQL pool**


## Exercise 1: Implementing a Star Schema

Star schema is a mature modeling approach widely adopted by relational data warehouses. It requires modelers to classify their model tables as either dimension or fact.

**Dimension tables** describe business entitiesâ€”the things you model. Entities can include products, people, places, and concepts including time itself. The most consistent table you'll find in a star schema is a date dimension table. A dimension table contains a key column (or columns) that acts as a unique identifier, and descriptive columns.

Dimension tables contain attribute data that might change but usually changes infrequently. For example, a customer's name and address are stored in a dimension table and updated only when the customer's profile changes. To minimize the size of a large fact table, the customer's name and address don't need to be in every row of a fact table. Instead, the fact table and the dimension table can share a customer ID. A query can join the two tables to associate a customer's profile and transactions.

**Fact tables** store observations or events, and can be sales orders, stock balances, exchange rates, temperatures, etc. A fact table contains dimension key columns that relate to dimension tables, and numeric measure columns. The dimension key columns determine the dimensionality of a fact table, while the dimension key values determine the granularity of a fact table. For example, consider a fact table designed to store sale targets that has two dimension key columns `Date` and `ProductKey`. It's easy to understand that the table has two dimensions. The granularity, however, can't be determined without considering the dimension key values. In this example, consider that the values stored in the Date column are the first day of each month. In this case, the granularity is at month-product level.

Generally, dimension tables contain a relatively small number of rows. Fact tables, on the other hand, can contain a very large number of rows and continue to grow over time.
